# node-red-contrib-nbrowser
Provides a virtual web browser (a.k.a. "headless browser") appearing as a node. The web browser is based on the open source electron.atom.io and nightmarejs.org projects. The node edit panel provides the ability to easily navigate and automate most web browser operations as well as display an interactive window for easy debugging. In headless mode the browser omits downloading images and is highly optimized for speed and performance. This makes testing and automation incredibly fast and versatile. Extended features include the ability to inspect DOM elements, upload & download files, and answer common dialogs.  

By default, a node will use or create the web browser "instance" in **msg.nbrowser** property and will have a pre-added goto method to navigate to the URL from an incoming **msg.payload**. After methods have been applied, the resulting HTML source is output in the **msg.payload**. Developers have the option of analyzing content in their flow before navigating or taking additional actions on a given page by simply dropping additional nbrowser nodes in their flow diagram. When used with the **[node-red-contrib-string](https://github.com/steveorevo/node-red-contrib-string)** node and the **switch** node, **nbrowser** enables an unprecedented level of versatility and functionality to the already powerful Node-RED set of capabilities.

## Example
In this example, we can see a flow using nbrowser in conjunction with the [credentials](https://github.com/Steveorevo/node-red-contrib-credentials) node to login to a WordPress' admin dashboard. The setting for the node shows the methods for `gotoURL`, `type`, `click`, and `wait`. The default results are the HTML source code for the current web page; which passes on to a Node-RED html node. The html node isolates the .update-count element's content and reveals it in the debug output.

## Installation
Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically ~/.node-red):

    npm install node-red-contrib-nbrowser

The **nbrowser** node will appear in the palette under the advanced group.

Note: You can install nbrowser using Node-RED's Manage Palette -> Install option; however, the current version requires that you restart the Node-RED server.

## Options
***Show browser window instance?***

Displays the Electron browser instance to aid development. Use Command (Mac) / Ctrl (Windows) + Shift + I to display developer tools & the DOM inspector. Note: image downloading is suppressed in headless mode but is turned on for convenience when this option is enabled.

***Close instance after methods?***

IMPORTANT! Use this option to destroy the browser instance after processing all methods or place an nbrowser node at the end of your flow with this option enabled to close an existing instance window. This is especially important when running in headless mode; otherwise it is not physically possible to close the window.

***Ignore SSL certificate errors?***
This option can be used to continue loading a web page when the given certificate is untrusted. Commonly used to allow self-signed certificates that are used during development.

## Methods
The following methods can be used to navigate or analyze a given web page. Many of the methods below require a valid CSS selector to take effect. Unlike NightmereJS or PhantomJS, nbrowser will wait for the given CSS selector to appear; eliminating the need to insert additional wait methods. When present, a selector parameter may come from a literal string or any property of global, flow, or msg contexts. Selectors that fail to appear will generate a catchable timeout error.

Additional parameters may include a flow output or a context property to store an existing value. If a flow output is selected, the resulting value is often delivered in the msg.payload context property.

## Utility Functions
**removeTargetAttr** - is a utility function that is callable from the evalJavaScript method. This function is useful to prevent a new window from spawning when clicking an anchor link. Instead, the existing browser window will be used for navigation.

**msg.nbrowser_delay** - The delay between nbrowser nodes within the same flow; default is 1500ms but can be changed via the input to nbrowser. Increase this value to avoid `navigation error -3` and `ERR_ABORTED`.
